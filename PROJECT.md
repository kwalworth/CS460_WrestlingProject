# Autonomous Robotics Project - Cyberbotics Humanoid Wrestling
## Introduction
Welcome to our Autonomous Robotics project repository! In this project, we are combining various concepts from sensing, kinematics, path planning, task execution, and vision to participate in the Cyberbotics Humanoid Wrestling competition. Our goal is to showcase and implement algorithms discussed in our class while exploring and pushing the boundaries of our interests in robotics.

## Project Description
### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust humanoid robot controller capable of competing in the Cyberbotics Wrestling competition. We aim to demonstrate the integration of theoretical concepts learned in class into a real-world robotics application.

### Key Components
Cyberbotics Open Repository: There are many functions already created for the robots provided by Cyberbotics for this competition. Several of our implementation strategies will utilize these function from Cyberbotics to try and win the competition.

Sensing: Implementing sensing techniques to perceive changes elevation during the wrestling match.

Kinematics: Implementing kinematic models for precise control of our humanoid robot's movements, ensuring both agility and stability.

Path Planning: Developing efficient path planning algorithms to navigate the robot through the wrestling arena, avoiding falling while covering as much ground as possible and strategically positioning itself for offensive and defensive maneuvers.

Task Execution: Integrating task execution mechanisms to translate high-level strategies into low-level motor commands for the robot's actuators.

Vision: Leveraging computer vision to identify opponent's location and determine best time to execute offensive maneuvers.

### Features
Modular Codebase: Our project is organized into modular components, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend. Each key concept is implemented in a separate module for clarity and maintainability.

Simulation Environment: To facilitate testing and development, we use the simulation environment provided by Cyberbotics Humanoid Wrestling competition.
