Autonomous Robotics Project - Cyberbotics Humanoid Wrestling
Overview
Welcome to our Autonomous Robotics senior project repository! In this project, we are combining various concepts from sensing, kinematics, path planning, task execution, and vision to participate in the Cyberbotics Humanoid Wrestling competition. Our goal is to showcase and implement algorithms discussed in our senior-level computer science class while exploring and pushing the boundaries of our interests in robotics.

Project Description
Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and intelligent humanoid robot capable of competing in the Cyberbotics Wrestling competition. We aim to demonstrate the integration of theoretical concepts learned in class into a real-world robotics application.

Key Components
Sensing: Implementing advanced sensing techniques to perceive the environment, opponents, and dynamic changes during the wrestling match.

Kinematics: Designing and implementing kinematic models for precise control of our humanoid robot's movements, ensuring both agility and stability.

Path Planning: Developing efficient path planning algorithms to navigate the robot through the wrestling arena, avoiding obstacles and strategically positioning itself for offensive and defensive maneuvers.

Task Execution: Integrating task execution mechanisms to translate high-level strategies into low-level motor commands for the robot's actuators.

Vision: Leveraging computer vision to analyze the opponent's movements, identify patterns, and make informed decisions during the match.

Features
Modular Codebase: Our project is organized into modular components, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend. Each key concept is implemented in a separate module for clarity and maintainability.

Simulation Environment: To facilitate testing and development, we provide a simulation environment that mimics the conditions of the Cyberbotics Humanoid Wrestling competition.

Documentation: Comprehensive documentation is available to guide users through the setup, configuration, and understanding of our codebase.
